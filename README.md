## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Basic Array Operations** â€“ Creating arrays, indexing, slicing, reshaping.
- **Mathematical Functions** â€“ Sum, mean, standard deviation, cumulative operations.
- **Broadcasting** â€“ Working with arrays of different shapes.
- **Random Module** â€“ Generating random data for experiments.
- **Saving and Loading Data** â€“ Using `.npy` and `.csv` formats.
- **Visualization** â€“ Plotting results with Matplotlib (optional).

## ðŸ’» Tools Used
- Python 3.13.7
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
These notebooks are purely for **learning and practice** purposes, helping me build a strong foundation in data manipulation and numerical analysis using NumPy.
